Using a CASE command fill in the data for the bonus column. • Non-credit card holders will receive a bonus of zero (cctype: N/A). • Customers who hold a Visa or who live in New Brunswick the bonus will be $140 • All American Express holders will get $100 (cctype: Amex) • Customers who live in any province other than New Brunswick and have a MasterCard will get $70 as bonus. • Then, customers with any other credit cards will get $59.99 as bonus. In your report, explain the considerations that were made in constructing this statement.
